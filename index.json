A LAN is a \u0026ldquo;Local Area Network\u0026rdquo;, and in general usage, it is what your computer connects to on the network. You can connect either with a wire (usually Ethernet), or Wirelessly (Wifi). When you connect your computer to the LAN, it is given a private address. In other words, only other computers on the same LAN can access your computer directly. It\u0026rsquo;s like your computer exists in it\u0026rsquo;s own little world. Big networks can be broken up into many segments. Each of these segments is like a mini LAN, and contains it\u0026rsquo;s own set of addresses. We set up networks like this for many reasons, but one is to handle network congestion. If you were on the same physical network as all the machines at work, your network adapter would see all the traffic. By using network segments and devices called network switches (or just \u0026ldquo;switches\u0026rdquo;), traffic can be routed from one part of the network to another.\nLANS are not Publicly Available An important point is that when you are connected to a LAN, you almost certainly do not have a publicly available address. This means devices outside your network cannot communicate directly with your computer. So, for example, putting a web server on your machine and sending a link to a friend outside your network so they can see your web page probably isn\u0026rsquo;t going to work. From outside the LAN traffic comes in and must be routed to the internal machines for which that traffic is intended. These devices are called routers and are maintained by the networking team.\nFor example, the network that is used in production is a separate network from the one we use to development. You can\u0026rsquo;t get from \u0026ldquo;here\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;there\u0026rdquo; because there are no routes that are available.\n","description":"","id":6,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"Local Area Networks","uri":"https://hypertheory.training/docs/networking/local-area-networks/"},{"content":"Naming Nodes on the Network Each computer (technically a \u0026ldquo;node\u0026rdquo;) on the network has three ways they are identified:\n A \u0026ldquo;friendly\u0026rdquo; hostname. Your computer name. An internet IP Address A MAC Address  So, for example, you try to connect to another machine on your network you might use a UNC address. That is something like typing \\\\somecomputer\\someshare into the Windows Explorer address bar, or mapping a network drive. The somecomputer portion of that is the hostname. You can see your hostname by running a windows command prompt (Type Windows Key + R, then type CMD) and typing hostname (this command works on Macs and Linux operating systems, too).\nSo, when you make a request for that \u0026ldquo;friendly name\u0026rdquo;, the computer needs to know what the Internet Address is. It uses various techniques to find this address (like DNS - discussed below), and then it has to decide which actual network card should it send this information to. Network cards have a unique identifier attached to them by the manufactuer called a MAC Address. (MAC - \u0026lsquo;Media Access Control\u0026rsquo;). Computers use a protocol called \u0026ldquo;Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)\u0026rdquo; on a LAN to figure out which specific machine should receive this data.\nURLs (Uniform Resource Locators) For getting to resources outside your LAN you probably are most familiar with URLs. You type something like \u0026lsquo;http://microsoft.com\u0026rsquo; into your computer browser\u0026rsquo;s address bar. The process is similiar here. A DNS lookup is performed to find the IP address on the microsoft.com node. It certainly isn\u0026rsquo;t on your LAN, so internet protocol routing finds where that machine physically resides.\n","description":"","id":7,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"Host Names and IP Addresses","uri":"https://hypertheory.training/docs/networking/host-names-and-ip/"},{"content":"LocalHost Just like we all have names (but probably not IP Addresses or MAC Addresses), we can always refer to ourselves as \u0026ldquo;me\u0026rdquo;. The \u0026ldquo;me\u0026rdquo; of computer networks is localhost. This is an alias for whatever machine you are currently on. So, if you type, for example, \\\\localhost in your Windows Explorer, you are saying \u0026ldquo;Show me the network stuff available on this machine\u0026rdquo;. If you machine\u0026rsquo;s hostname was captain-levi, typing \\\\localhost and \\\\captain-leviare the same things.\nEach node on the network also has a similar alias for it\u0026rsquo;s IP address. That is 127.0.0.1. That is the \u0026ldquo;me\u0026rdquo; of IP addresses.\n Note: You may have seen shirts or stickers that say \u0026ldquo;There is no place like 127.0.0.1\u0026rdquo;. If you didn\u0026rsquo;t get the joke before, you do now. And it isn\u0026rsquo;t all that funny so you haven\u0026rsquo;t been missing much. Computer humor is usually that way.\n Loopback and Unknown Sometimes you will see an IP address expressed as 0.0.0.0. This appears to work like localhost, because that is the default behavior. But this is actually a universal IP address for \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t freaking know!\u0026rdquo;.\nThe localhost and 127.0.0.1 are technically connected to a fake (virtual) network connect on your device called the \u0026ldquo;loopback adapter\u0026rdquo;. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t even hit your network card. But, if you use 0.0.0.0 You are saying \u0026ldquo;map this request to EVERY adapter that has an IP address on my machine\u0026rdquo;.\nUsing the hostname Command On a mac, windows, or linux command prompt you can use the hostname command to see what your current hostname is.\n1 2 3  jeffrygonzalez@Jeffrys-MacBook-Pro ~ % hostname Jeffrys-MacBook-Pro.local jeffrygonzalez@Jeffrys-MacBook-Pro ~ %   ","description":"","id":8,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"Localhost","uri":"https://hypertheory.training/docs/networking/localhost/"},{"content":"Virtual Private Networks A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a way for you to connect to an internal, private network from outside the network as if you were connected locally. The VPN creates a \u0026ldquo;tunnel\u0026rdquo; through the public internet that is encrypted and secure.\n","description":"","id":9,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"Virtual Private Networks","uri":"https://hypertheory.training/docs/networking/vpn/"},{"content":"Breaking up Big Networks Segments Our networks are broken into groups to manage traffic load. These are called segments, or subnets and IP addresses have embedded in them information about what segment or subnet your computer belongs to subnet masking.\nThe difference between a subnet and a segment is that segments are subnets that are physically separated from other network segments by hardware (usually a network switch).\nGateways A gateway is a device that translates from one network type to another. For example, on your home network, you might be using Wifi and Ethernet, but be connected to the internet by a cable modem or fiber. The gateway translates one kind of network to another kind of network.\n","description":"","id":10,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"Segments, Subnets, Gates and Switches","uri":"https://hypertheory.training/docs/networking/subnetting/"},{"content":"Conceptual Model for Complex Networks The OSI Model attempts to explain the architecture of computer networks, and the functionality that is provided all the way from how the electrons are received by your computer (Physical Layer at the bottom) to how applications talk to each other (Application Layer).\nYou might here networking people talking about the layers to identify the functionality of different types of software or hardware. A \u0026ldquo;Layer 2 Switch\u0026rdquo; vs. a \u0026ldquo;Layer 3 Switch\u0026rdquo; identifies where, on the OSI Model, the device operates.\nHTTP for example is a Layer 7 protocol. It does not directly depend on the layers at the bottom - you can use a web browser on a WiFi network, a DSL connection, or wired network. The responsibility for those kind of details are handled further down the \u0026ldquo;stack\u0026rdquo;.\n","description":"","id":11,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"OSI Model and Network Layers","uri":"https://hypertheory.training/docs/networking/osi-model/"},{"content":"Lorem est tota propiore conpellat pectoribus de\npectora summo.
